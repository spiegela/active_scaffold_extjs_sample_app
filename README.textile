h1. Active Scaffold Ext.JS Sample App

A rails application to build, test and demonstrate integration between Active Scaffold and a new Ext.JS based front-end.

h2. To install and run:

<pre>
# Clone the application 
git clone git://github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold_demo.git
cd active_scaffold_demo
git submodule init && git submodule update  
rake db:migrate
script/server
</pre>

h2. Project Goal:

p. The goal of this project is to create a complete active_scaffold front-end including all of AS's features (and hopefully more) with Ext.JS UI elements.  I chose Ext.JS because of the large number of UI elements to choose from.  I forsee a scaffolding that I can configure the "ui_type" (window, tab, tree, accordion, editor_grid, etc.) for each action (list, create, update, etc.) in my controllers.

p. Right now, I'm just working on getting all the features of AS working: basic CRUD, nested, search, validations...

h2. Project Status:

p. Currently, I have basic CRUD operations working (finally), and am working on nested, and search.  Next on the list will probably be validations...
